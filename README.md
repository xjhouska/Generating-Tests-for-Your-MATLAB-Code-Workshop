# Generating Tests for Your MATLAB<sup>&reg;</sup> Code Workshop

This workshop provides hands-on experience using some of MATLAB's latest software testing and automation features.
<br><br>

## About the workshop
This hands-on workshop will guide you through:
* forking your own copy of the Generating Tests for Your MATLAB Code Workshop repository on GitHub
* generating tests using your command history and MATLAB Copilot
* automatically finding and running existing tests
* exploring code coverage metrics for your code
* identifying missing code coverage and bugs that may be exposed with coverage metrics
* automating your testing using continuous integration (CI) practices with GitHub Actions


After completing the workshop, you should feel confident using some of MATLAB's latest software testing features and integrating your code with CI systems!
